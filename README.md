## I will provide the built .exe in the releases, if you feel inclined to test and view the application
For this implementation of Foo physics, I created a windows application that calculates the volume of a sphere.
This is noted to be the first of many tools to be added to the application.
The design of the application allows for modular implementation of a variety of new tools via additional tabs.
Additionally, the implementation is available to a wide range of people to be both used directly and to be adapted to larger software packages due to the modularity the tab implementation.
